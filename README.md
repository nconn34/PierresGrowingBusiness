**Pierre's Vendor and Order Tracker**

#### By **Nathan Conn**

#### This program was designed specifically for Pierre's Bakery to allow him to better track vendors and their orders and order history.


## Technologies Used

* C#
* NET 5.0
* MVC
* MS Testing



## Description

Pierre will be able to track his vendors that order his baked goods and assign each vendor a log of orders to track over time! If I had more time to work on this app, I would have included more CSS styling as well as more functionality to the order lists themselves. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repository.
* In the command line, run "dotnet restore" in both the Bakery and Bakery.Tests directories.
* In the command line, run "dotnet build" in both the Bakery and Bakery.Tests directories.
* In the command line, run "dotnet test" while in the Bakery.Tests directory to ensure the tests are properly working.
* In the command line, run "dotnet run" while in the Bakery directory to run the program.


## Known Bugs

*My foreach loop will not print multiple vendors to a line, and currently only will log one at a time and not display the name, however all other aspects of the page run and function when accessed from the dev tools console in Google Chrome.
