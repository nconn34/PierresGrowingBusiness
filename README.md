**Pierre's Bakery**

#### By **Nathan Conn**

#### This program will allow you to check the price of a bread or pastry order through Pierre's Bakery..


## Technologies Used

* C#
* NET 5.0
* dotnet
* MS Testing



## Description

When a user first enters the program, they will be asked if they want to purchase bread or pastries. After making their selection, a user may specify how much of either they want and will get a price for it.  

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repository.
* In the command line, run "dotnet restore" in both the BakedGoods and BakedGoods.Tests directories.
* In the command line, run "dotnet build" in both the BakedGoods and BakedGoods.Tests directories.
* In the command line, run "dotnet test" while in the BakedGoods.Tests directory to ensure the tests are properly working.
*  In the command line, run "dotnet run" while in the BakedGoods directory to run the program.


## Known Bugs

*Unsure of a decent equation for the pastry prices, so I will try and mess with some more logic and implementing a for loop like in the Bread class.
